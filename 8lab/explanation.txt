Project Name: Wizzy

Wizzy is an original platformer game with sprites created by myself (although I did use base models for all of them except the projectiles, eg: Legend of Zelda's Link). The objective is to get to the top of the screen as fast as possible before the platforms disappear. You may encounter enemies along the way. 

Controls: 
Arrow keys for jumping, and moving left to right.
Spacebar fires your projectile, only while on the ground. 
P will pause the game. 

Special Stuff:
If you look closely, you will note that there is a walking animation for the player sprite, (easier to see while on a platform). 
Colors for platforms have been randomized on an RBG scale for purples.
